This is a step-by-step javascript project to build an exercise timer.

## Block 1

### Stage 1 - Init
- create a web page that includes style and script
- the web page should have a title and a header
- the style should change the background color
- the script should log a message to the console

### Stage 2 - Intervals in Javascript
- create a new _function_ in the script file, that logs a message to the console
- execute your new function
- set a new _interval_ so that your function is executed repeatedly each second
