This is a step-by-step javascript project to build an exercise timer.

## Block 1

### Stage 1 - Init
- create a web page that includes style and script
- the web page should have a title and a header
- the style should change the background color
- the script should log a message to the console
- when you load the page, you should see the title in the browser bar, title in the page, the background colour of your choosing, and the message logged in the console.

### Stage 2 - Intervals in Javascript
- create a new _function_ in the script file, that logs a message to the console
- add a line that _executes_ your new function
- set a new _interval_ so that your function is executed repeatedly each second
- when you reload the page, the console should print your initial message from previous stage, the new message from the function execution, and then repeat the message every second after that.

### Stage 3 - Incrementing numbers
In this stage we will remove the message and replace it with an incrementing number.

- declare a new _variable_ in the script that holds an initial number.
- create a new function that will increase the number by one AND log it to the console.
- change the interval code to execute the number incrementing function every second.
- when your reload the page, the console should print a new number every second.
- clean your script file: remove all the code that is no longer used.
